# TOD (Tool On Demand) - Project Overview

## Vision Statement

TOD is a revolutionary MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables Large Language Models to dynamically request, generate, and deploy custom tools in real-time. Instead of being limited to pre-built tools, LLMs can now describe what they need and have those capabilities generated and deployed instantly.

## The Problem We're Solving

Current AI assistants are constrained by their pre-defined toolset. When a user asks for something requiring a specific API integration or custom functionality, the AI either:
- Says "I can't do that"
- Provides manual steps the user must execute
- Requires developers to pre-build every possible tool

**TOD changes this paradigm** by allowing AI assistants to become self-extending systems that can acquire new capabilities on-demand.

## How TOD Works

### Core Flow
```
User Request → LLM → "I need a tool for X" → TOD → Generated Tool → LLM uses new tool
```

### Example Scenario
1. **User**: "Show me my open GitHub PRs and highlight any that close issues"
2. **LLM**: "I need a tool to fetch GitHub PRs and extract linked issues"
3. **TOD**: Generates a complete MCP server with GitHub API integration
4. **LLM**: Uses the new tool to provide the requested information

## Technical Architecture

TOD operates as a **three-stage pipeline** with specialized teams handling each phase:

### Stage 1: Request Processing (Sunny's Team)
**Input**: Natural language tool request from LLM
```
"I need a tool to fetch weather data and convert temperatures"
```

**Output**: Structured specification
```python
{
    "tool_name": "weather_converter",
    "required_unit_functions": ["fetch_weather", "convert_temp"],
    "external_apis_needed": [{"weather_api": {"key": "API_KEY"}}]
}
```

### Stage 2: Function Generation (Harvey & James's Team)
**Input**: Tool specification
**Output**: Individual Python functions with proper error handling, authentication, and testing

```python
{
    "unit_functions": {
        "fetch_weather": "def fetch_weather(city): ...",
        "convert_temp": "def convert_temp(celsius): ..."
    }
}
```

### Stage 3: MCP Server Assembly (Shahel's Team)
**Input**: Generated functions
**Output**: Complete, deployable MCP server

```python
{
    "mcp_server_code": "# Full MCP server implementation",
    "deployment_config": {"port": 3001, "env_vars": ["API_KEY"]}
}
```

## Key Features

### 🚀 **Dynamic Tool Generation**
- LLMs can request tools for any API or functionality
- No pre-configuration required
- Tools generated in seconds, not days

### 🔧 **Modular Architecture**
- Functions broken into reusable units
- Smart composition of complex workflows
- Built-in error handling and validation

### 🛡️ **Production Ready**
- Generated code includes comprehensive error handling
- Automatic test generation
- MCP protocol compliance

### 🌐 **API Integration**
- Supports any REST API
- Automatic authentication handling
- Smart pagination and rate limiting

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **APIs**: RESTful services (GitHub, weather, etc.)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal (requests, re, os)

## Real-World Applications

### For Developers
- **Dynamic API Exploration**: "Create a tool to list all Stripe customers with failed payments"
- **Data Processing**: "Build a tool to parse CSV files and generate charts"
- **System Integration**: "I need to sync Notion pages with GitHub issues"

### For Business Users
- **Report Generation**: "Create a tool to pull sales data and format it for executives"
- **Social Media**: "Build something to post updates across all our platforms"
- **Analytics**: "I need to track website performance and alert on anomalies"

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Zero Setup Time**: Tools are generated instantly, no manual coding required
2. **Infinite Extensibility**: Any API or functionality can become a tool
3. **AI-Native Design**: Built specifically for LLM interaction patterns
4. **Production Quality**: Generated code includes testing and error handling

## Success Metrics

- **Tool Generation Speed**: Sub-10 second tool creation
- **Success Rate**: >90% of generated tools work correctly
- **User Adoption**: LLMs successfully using TOD-generated tools
- **API Coverage**: Support for 100+ popular APIs

## Future Vision

TOD represents the first step toward **truly autonomous AI systems** that can extend their own capabilities. Imagine AI assistants that:
- Learn new skills by generating tools for unfamiliar domains
- Share generated tools with other AI systems
- Continuously expand their capabilities based on user needs

**TOD isn't just a tool generator—it's the foundation for self-improving AI systems.**
